# Gap Learning

This application is a project inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The idea is to have a timer that will allow you to focus on a task for a set amount of time, then take a break for a set amount of time. This is repeated until the task is complete.
